* Welcome to my emacs config!

I've been using emacs for about a year now, and it's just become such a large part of my life so fast.

This quote just really hits home with me.
Yes, I am a computer science student, planning on becoming a software engineer.
Yes, I do write some sort of code almost every day, but even if I didn't I would still use emacs.
The level of comfort I get from just being inside this emacs configuration that I have worked on and tailored to my exact workflow is unparalleled.

** Who this is for
This configuration is somewhat of a hackjob, constantly changing, and yet unbelievably functional.
This configuration is very effective, I can tell you that for certain.
However, it's very effective for me.
I built this conf for me, so it will likely be quite hard for someone else to step in and be fluent right away.

** Keybindings
While most of the default keybindings are left intact (mainly because I don't use them) I've implemented a modal system of editing using the Modalka package.
My modal keybindings are not vim bindings at all.
I did take some inspiration from the likes of evil, but the bindings are all different.
I tried to make them very ergonomic and intuitive, and they certainly are for me, but again, this may not be the case for other people.
