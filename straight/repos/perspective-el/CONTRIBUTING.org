* Contributing to Perspective

Thank you for considering making a code contribution to Perspective!

Please follow the following procedures before opening a pull request.


** Run automated tests

Perspective has a growing handful of tests. Please run them manually before [[https://travis-ci.org/nex3/perspective-el][Travis CI]] does.

From your ~perspective-el~ repository, run the following:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
EMACS=/path/to/emacs make test
#+END_SRC


** Test in the MELPA sandbox

Emacs makes extending it so frictionless that unexpected dependencies can creep in. A package intended for use by other people must be run in a minimal environment to verify that all its dependencies are explicit.

In addition, the Emacs byte-compiler introduces some unexpected behaviors, particularly with eager macroexpansion. They are well-flagged by warnings.

MELPA makes these things (relatively) easy to test. Refer to the [[https://github.com/melpa/melpa/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.org#test-your-recipe][Test your recipe]] section of [[https://github.com/melpa/melpa/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.org][MELPAâ€™s CONTRIBUTING.org]] documentation for details, but here is a terse summary of the process:

- Clone the [[https://github.com/melpa/melpa/][melpa repository]], and then change ~melpa/recipes/perspective~ to point to your local Perspective repo:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(perspective :fetcher git :url "/home/you/code/perspective-el")
#+END_SRC

- From the melpa repo, run:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
EMACS_COMMAND=/path/to/emacs make recipes/perspective
#+END_SRC

- Install Ivy and Counsel in the melpa sandbox:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
EMACS_COMMAND=/path/to/emacs make sandbox INSTALL=ivy
# exit emacs after this step
EMACS_COMMAND=/path/to/emacs make sandbox INSTALL=counsel
# exit emacs after this step
#+END_SRC

- Install Perspective:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
EMACS_COMMAND=/path/to/emacs make sandbox INSTALL=perspective
#+END_SRC

*Important:* This step should produce no byte-compiler errors or warnings.

*Also important:* After making changes to your ~perspective-el~ repository, commit them locally, or the melpa recipe builder will not pick them up! Rerun ~make recipes/perspective~, delete the ~perspective~ directory in ~melpa/sandbox~, and rerun ~make sandbox INSTALL=perspective~ to look at the byte-compiler output.
