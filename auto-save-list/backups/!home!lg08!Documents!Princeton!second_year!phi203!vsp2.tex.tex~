\section{Excerpt}
\label{sec:orgd3ada37}

\paragraph{}
From Vogel, “Skepticism and Inference the Best Explanation”:
     "More than two thousand years ago, the philosopher Zhuangzi posed the question:
     How can a man know that he is a man, rather than a butterfly dreaming that he is
     a man? Later, René Descartes asked how he could be sure that his sensory experience
     wasn’t caused by an evil demon, who was bent on deceiving him. 1 And, today, you
     might consider the possibility that, instead of you really seeing this book, your brain
     is being stimulated by a computer to make it appear to you, falsely, that you’re seeing
     this book."

\section{Argument}
\label{sec:org650df6a}

\paragraph{}
This excerpt from one of Vogel's writings is simply part of his introduction in which he sets up his future argument about how we can actually determine a more reasonable hypothesis about the world we witness around us. His goal is to simply reference the previous arguments that he will respond to, but after reading these arguments myself as well as what Vogel has to say in response, I just don't understand the significance of these arguements. Some philosophical arguements seem to have very serious consequences to me. Arguments for and against the existence of a god, for example can have very serious consequences in the way I choose to live my life. However, arguements such as Vogel's and Descartes', while being interesting to think about, just don't have any real consequences on people's lives.

\paragraph{}
It's very natural for people, especially philosophers, to question the reliability of people's senses and the very existence, or at least the realness of the outside world we witness, but it's actually quite unconsequential. Let's say for instance, that one could theoretically prove that the outside world is actually not real, that we are being tricked by an evil demon, or a computer, or we're dreaming. Even if we knew this for a fact, would we really act any different? Some might initially say "yes!", if none of this is "real," it doesn't matter what we do. We can go rob a bank, kill a bunch of people, run around naked since there are no real consequences. However, my response, is that there are actually very real consequences even if there aren't any in the "real" world. The much more important question than whether or not there is an outside world, is actually whether or not our "existence" in the world is continuous. For example, when I'm in a dream, even if I am fully aware of the fact that I'm dreaming, unless I know for a fact that I'm going to wake up the next instance, I'm going to do everything I can to make sure that my dream remains just a dream and doesn't turn into a nightmare. Even though whatever I do in the dream doesn't affect me once I wake up, I'm still always going to act reasonably in the dream since how I act would have consequences for my general well-being in the dream. Another skeptic of me, might say, well, does it really matter what your well-being is in the dream? As soon as you wake up, you might not even remember your dream at all, so what's the point of maximizing your well-being? Well, my response would be that everyone dies at some point at which case the well-being they created for themselves in life basically goes away, and yet everyone still tries to maximize their well-being in life. To argue whether this should be the case is outside the scope of this paper, but if one has problems with my dream argument, they would have to argue against the importance of maximizing well-being in life.
