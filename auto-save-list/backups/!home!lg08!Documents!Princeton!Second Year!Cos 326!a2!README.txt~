=======================================================================
For each of the following questions, 

(A) give the answer 

(B) give the shell command (or commands) you used to answer the
question and in a sentence, explain why your shell command gives you
helpful data.  

Use the data given in the files G.txt, PG.txt, PG-13.txt, R.txt for
the set of top-grossing films in each rating category (G, PG, PG-13
and R). 

1.  What is the top-grossing film of all time (use the alltime.txt data)?

(A)Gone with the Wind|MGM|1582.0094|1939

(B)./boxoffice -sort-gross < data/alltime.txt | ./boxoffice -take 1
This is helpful since it sorts all the movies from alltime.txt and then just takes the top one

2. What is the 50th ranked R film by gross on the list?

(A)The Silence of the Lambs|Orion|130.742922|1991

(B)./boxoffice -sort-gross < data/R.txt | ./boxoffice -drop 49 | ./boxoffice -take 1
This is helpful since it sorts all the movies from R.txt and then, ignore the first 49,
and then just prints the 50th movie in the ranking

3. Suppose you had a chance to make 1 film with a top director and the
director was so good you were guaranteed that whatever film you made
would be in the top 5 grossing films in its ratings category (G, PG,
PG-13, R) --- and equally likely to be ranked 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5.  What
rating (G, PG, PG-13, R) would you choose to give your film if you
wanted to make the most money?

(A) PG-13

(B)/boxoffice -sort-gross < data/G.txt | ./boxoffice -take 5 | ./boxoffice -average
The average gross is: 335.8458128
/boxoffice -sort-gross < data/PG.txt | ./boxoffice -take 5 | ./boxoffice -average
The average gross is: 429.210264
./boxoffice -sort-gross < data/PG-13.txt | ./boxoffice -take 5 | ./boxoffice -average
The average gross is: 555.686177
/boxoffice -sort-gross < data/R.txt | ./boxoffice -take 5 | ./boxoffice -average
The average gross is: 283.7813354

These commands are helpful since they give me the average gross of the top five
movies in each category, so all I need to do is find the biggest.


4. Using the data in alltime.txt, would you have preferred to make
money off of movies in the 70s or in the 80s?

(A)I would have preferred to make money off of movies in the 70s.

(B)/boxoffice -decade 70 < data/alltime.txt | ./boxoffice -average
The average gross is: 495.1192625
./boxoffice -decade 80 < data/alltime.txt | ./boxoffice -average
The average gross is: 418.712338235

These commands are helpful since they grab all the information from
alltime.txt, filter it to just the movies in the given decade,
and then find the average gross of the movies in that decade
so all I have to do is compare the two numbers

5. Using the data in alltime.txt, which studio made the most
money off of movies in the 60s?

(A)Fox made the most money

(B)./boxoffice -decade 60 < data/alltime.txt | ./boxoffice -by-studio | ./boxoffice -sort-studio

This command is helpful since it grabs all the movies made in the 60's from
alltime.txt, calculates the gross of each studio of each
movie, and finally sorts these studios by gross so all
I have to do is pick the top one.


In doing this homework I used the following sources:

1. Sources I don't need to mention   [see notes 1 and 4]
2. Authorized sources  [see notes 2 and 4]
   [Ed was very helpful for this one,
   https://stackoverflow.com/questions/257605/ocaml-match-expression-inside-
another-one,
]
3. Unauthorized sources [see notes 3 and 4]
   [list here]

This paper represents my own work in accordance with University regulations.

Signed, [your name(s): Lucas Gen]

------------------------------------------------------------------------

NOTE 1:   Sources you don't need to mention
  (unless you paste code from them verbatim) include: 
  this semester's lectures and precepts,  the course web site, 
  the assignment handout (download), Real World OCaml, and the OCaml manual.

NOTE 2:  Authorized sources include:
    professors and preceptors (outside of lecture or precept);
    advice from other students (but not looking at their solutions
    to this course's homeworks);
    other books, and (within reason) web sites such as stackoverflow.com
    (for general questions about OCaml bugs, not for solutions to
    the homework).
  List by name, by URL, or by bibliographic citation, as appropriate.

NOTE 3:  "Why would I list an unauthorized source?"
  Using an unauthorized source without citing it is an Academic Violation
  under Princeton University's disciplinary code, and can result
  in suspension from the University for one or more semesters.

  Using an unauthorized source and citing it clearly is not an Academic
  Violation, it is "merely" a violation of this homework's instructions,
  and can result in (at most) getting a zero on this homework.

  Unauthorized sources include, at least: other people's solutions
  to these (or similar) homework problems.

NOTE 4.  If you paste in code from from these sites,
  you should clearly cite it at the point of use, in accordance with
  Section 2.4.6 of RRR  for "direct quotation or extensive paraphrase".

  Please limit the amount of this that you do in accordance with the
  principle that the purpose of these homeworks is so that you
  can learn how to do things yourself.
