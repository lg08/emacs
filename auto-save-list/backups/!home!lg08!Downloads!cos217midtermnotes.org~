*** a
the bug is that the function is effectively just checking if the char d appears in the given string
danger
*** b
it produces the wrong answer when an odd number of chars are entered since it would try to print the eof char

void q2b(void) {
 while (getchar() != EOF)

 int char = getchar();
 if (char == EOF){
 return;
 }
 putchar(char);
}
*** c
it returns the wrong value when all of the ints in the array are negative
