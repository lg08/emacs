PROBLEM 3 - DMM ERROR CLASSIFICATION - 14 points / 80 total on exam
=====================================================================

For the statements in each part of this question, indicate one or
more appropriate statuses from this list:

ML - Memory Leak: aka garbage creation
BD - Bad Dereference: dereferences a NULL pointer or a pointer to
     memory that was never allocated or has already been freed
IF - Improper Free: frees a pointer to memory that was never
     allocated or has already been freed
OK - Okay: exhibits no dynamic memory problem

If different statuses could result depending on the result of a call
to malloc, calloc, or realloc, then list all possible statuses.
You do NOT have to delineate the cases in which each would result.

Each part of this question is independent from the others,
but you should assume for each that:
* p is a char pointer pointing to k bytes that have been allocated
  in the heap, at least one of which is the null byte ('\0').
* q is a char pointer


a.
           strcpy(calloc(strlen(p)+1, sizeof(char)), p);
Status(es):

b.
           for(i=0; i<k; i++) free(p+i);
Status(es):

c.
           free(p); printf("%ul\n", p);
Status(es):

d.
           free(p++);
Status(es):

e.
           q = p; free(q); printf("%s", p);
Status(es):

f.         Hint: man 3 free
           free(p); p=NULL; free(p);
Status(es):

g.
           p = realloc(p, 2*k);
Status(es):
